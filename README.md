# Time-series-analysis

Model that forecasts the consumption of electricity at SMU university with 4% mean absolute percentage error. 

Executive Summary 
 
• MT123 Electricity dataset has been used to forecast the consumption of electricity based on consumption history. • It contains 15-minute interval consumption from the year 2011 to 2014. • We used the Time series analysis, Linear regression, Support vector regressor and neural networks to train the model and picked up the best model with low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) on validation set. • Trained the models for the 15 minute, hourly and daily electricity consumption. 
 
Objective 
 
• Our objective is to forecast the electricity consumption from the given MT123 Electricity dataset. 
• Decomposed time series data helps in analysing the trends and seasonality of consumption in 15 minute, hourly and daily intervals through which we can predict the minimum and maximum consumption intervals.
